# Annie Duke Brain Pack

> **1034 knowledge atoms** · **1713 typed connections** · **9 unified skills (1 router + 8 reasoning modes)**
> From [brainsforfree.com](https://brainsforfree.com)

## What This Is

A structured knowledge graph of Annie Duke's thinking, extracted from Three major books (Thinking in Bets, How to Decide, Quit), TED talks, 40+ video interviews and podcast appearances. Designed to be loaded as context into any LLM — Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, or any AI tool that accepts system prompts.

This isn't a chatbot or a persona. It's a **thinking partner** grounded in Annie's actual ideas, frameworks, and worldview.

## Quick Start

1. Install the brain pack into `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/brains/annie-duke/`
2. In your AI tool, activate the brain:
   ```
   /brain annie-duke
   ```
3. Then run any thinking skill:
   ```
   /advise "Should I keep investing in a project that hasn't shown results after two years?"
   ```

You should get a response that cites specific atoms, synthesizes Annie's perspective, and recommends what to do next.

## Unified Skill Architecture

Every brain pack ships the **same 9 skill files**. They're brain-agnostic — the 8 thinking skills resolve which brain to use by (1) reading `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/state/active-brain.txt`, or (2) taking an inline slug as the first argument.

This means:

- **Install this brain pack first** → `/brain annie-duke` activates it, then `/advise` / `/teach` / `/surprise` all work.
- **Install more brain packs later** → they drop into `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/brains/`, auto-registered in `brains/index.json`, and the same 9 skills work for them too. No reinstall, no collisions.
- **Override per call** — `/advise paul-graham should I start a company?` uses Paul Graham for that one call regardless of active brain.
- **Cross-brain mode** — `/debate annie-duke paul-graham originality` contrasts two thinkers.

## The Knowledge Graph

**1034 atoms** — Each atom is a self-contained insight with topic tags, source date, confidence score, and source URL.

**1713 connections** — Typed relationships between atoms: supports, contradicts, extends, related, inspired_by. These let skills trace reasoning chains and surface productive tensions.

**16 topic clusters** — Thinking in bets, resulting, decision quality, quitting, cognitive bias, probabilistic thinking, risk, uncertainty.

**Date range:** 2002 — 2025

## How to Use

**For Claude Code / Cowork:** The skills in `pack/skills/` load automatically once the pack is installed to `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/brains/annie-duke/`. Run `/brain annie-duke` to activate.

**For Cursor:** Add `brain-context.md` to your `.cursor/rules` or project instructions, then use the skill prompts as templates.

**For ChatGPT / Claude.ai:** Paste `brain-context.md` as your first message or system prompt, then describe which skill behavior you want (e.g. "respond as /advise would").

**For any other tool:** Load `brain-context.md` as context at the start of your session.

## Skill Workflows

Chain skills for deeper results (all can be prefixed with a brain slug or rely on the active brain):

- **Decide:** `/advise` → `/debate` → `/coach`
- **Learn:** `/teach` → `/evolve` → `/coach`
- **Create:** `/surprise` → `/connect` → `/predict`
- **Forecast:** `/predict` → `/debate` → `/advise`
- **Daily ritual:** `/surprise` each morning

## Cross-Brain Features

Install multiple brain packs and the unified skills auto-discover all of them via `${BRAINSFOR_HOME:-~/.brainsfor}/brains/index.json`:

- `/connect <slug-a> <slug-b> <topic>` — semantic bridges across two thinkers
- `/debate <slug-a> <slug-b> <position>` — stress-test from two worldviews
- `/brain list` — see everything installed
- `/brain <slug>` — switch active brain without reinstalling anything

## About Annie Duke

Annie Duke is a former World Series of Poker champion turned decision-making expert and author. Drawing on a career at the highest levels of professional poker, she has developed a rigorous framework for making better decisions under uncertainty — and knowing when to walk away.

## Sources & Ethics

This brain pack was built exclusively from **freely available, public sources** — interviews, podcasts, public talks, blog posts, free newsletters, YouTube videos, and publicly shared excerpts. No transcripts from commercial works (e.g., audiobooks, paid courses) or paywalled essays were used to derive this brain.

Where a thinker's book ideas appear in the knowledge graph, they are represented as they exist in the public discourse: book reviews, author interviews, press coverage, conference talks, and LLM-generated summaries of widely discussed concepts. Authors typically share their core ideas through extensive public appearances and media — those public representations are what this brain captures.
